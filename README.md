# Hola!

This is a response to a coding challenge as set out by **Medibank**.

User stories are lined out *below*.

## User stories:

1) As an end-user, I want to see the values stored inside that URL (as referenced on their Github) on my application.

2) As an end-user, I want there to be two lists separated by gender identities.

3) As an end-user, I want to see the names of each 'cat', with their names split into lists of male and female owners.

4) As an end-user, I want this application to be able to be rendered on a web browser.

## Example output:

    Male:

    Garfield
    Tom
    Max
    Jim


    Female:
    
    Garfield
    Tabby
    Simba
